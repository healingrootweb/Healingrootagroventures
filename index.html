                    <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-2xl h-64 overflow-y-auto custom-scrollbar text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-4 mb-6">
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Early Maturity</p>
                        <p>✔ TME 419 is an improved cassava variety developed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) to help farmers achieve faster harvest cycles. Unlike local varieties that may take longer to mature, TME 419 reaches harvestable stage earlier, allowing farmers to plan production efficiently and enjoy quicker returns on investment. Early maturity also helps reduce exposure to prolonged drought, pests, and diseases, making it a smarter choice for modern farming.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">High and Consistent Yield</p>
                        <p>✔ One of the strongest advantages of TME 419 is its ability to produce high and consistent yields when properly managed. The variety develops large, well-filled tubers with excellent starch content. Even under varying weather conditions, farmers can rely on stable output, making it ideal for both smallholder farmers and large-scale commercial cassava production.</p>

                        <p>✔ TME 419 has been bred to withstand major cassava diseases, particularly Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), which is a major cause of yield loss in traditional cassava farms. This resistance results in healthier plants, reduced crop failure, and lower spending on disease control measures. Farmers benefit from stronger stands and more predictable harvests.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Excellent Processing Quality</p>
                        <p>✔ This cassava variety is highly suitable for multiple processing purposes. It performs excellently in the production of garri, fufu, cassava flour, starch, and industrial raw materials. Its high dry matter content makes it attractive to processors and agro-industries, increasing market demand and selling opportunities for farmers.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Strong Field Performance</p>
                        <p>✔ TME 419 establishes quickly after planting and develops a robust stem and root system. The plants show good tolerance to varying soil conditions and respond well to recommended agronomic practices such as fertilizer application and proper spacing. This makes it suitable for diverse farming environments across Nigeria.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Widely Accepted and Market-Trusted</p>
                        <p>✔ Due to its performance and reliability, TME 419 is one of the most widely accepted cassava varieties in Nigeria. Buyers, processors, and aggregators recognize it for its quality and yield potential, giving farmers better market access and pricing confidence.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Ideal for Commercial and Small-Scale Farming</p>
                        <p>✔ Whether you are a beginner farmer or an established agribusiness operator, TME 419 offers flexibility. It is suitable for backyard farms, cooperative farms, and large mechanized plantations. Its predictable performance helps farmers plan harvesting, processing, and sales efficiently.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Supports Food Security and Income Generation</p>
                        <p>✔ By combining early maturity, high yield, and processing versatility, TME 419 plays an important role in food security while also serving as a reliable income-generating crop for farming households and agribusinesses.</p>

                    <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-2xl h-64 overflow-y-auto custom-scrollbar text-sm text-slate-700 space-y-4 mb-6">
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">High Oil Yield Potential</p>
                        <p>✔ Tenera oil palm seedlings are the most commercially preferred oil palm variety due to their exceptionally high oil content. The fruits produced contain a thin shell and a thick mesocarp, which significantly increases palm oil extraction rates compared to traditional dura varieties. This makes Tenera the top choice for farmers aiming to maximize profit per hectare.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Fast and Vigorous Growth</p>
                        <p>✔ These seedlings are carefully selected for strong early growth, allowing them to establish quickly after transplanting. With a well-developed root system, Tenera seedlings adapt well to different soil types and climatic conditions across Nigeria, ensuring healthy field performance from planting stage.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Early Fruiting Advantage</p>
                        <p>✔ Tenera oil palm begins fruiting earlier than unimproved varieties. This early fruiting means farmers can start harvesting fresh fruit bunches sooner, leading to quicker cash flow and reduced waiting time before returns on investment begin.</p>
                        <p class="font-bold text-green-800 underline">Long-Term Plantation Investment</p>
                        <p>✔ Oil palm is a long-life crop capable of producing for 25–30 years when properly managed. Planting Tenera seedlings is not just farming—it is a long-term agribusiness investment that guarantees sustained income over decades. This makes it ideal for farmers planning generational wealth through agriculture.</p>
